# Petter <br>
What is it about:
<br>
Petter is all about connecting people who want pets with pets needing a furever home. 
Sometimes it can be too hard to find the one, ergo we created Petter. 
To make sure that adoption stays a joyful journey Petter gives users the option of sharing their success stories with other users.

# Branches  <br>
When you are working on a feature you need to be working on your own branch - to avoid merge conflict
When you finish working you need to create a pull request from your branch into a master
Pull request needs to be reviewed by a team member
Any code that needs to be changed needs to be fixed
After it's reviewed it needs to be approved
Once it's been approved it needs to be merged into master
# Rules <br>
<li>No one is allowed to push to master</li>
<li>No one should work in master ( because if you work in the master branch our history will be nill</li>
<li>When you are creating a new branch file you will need to be created from master </li>
